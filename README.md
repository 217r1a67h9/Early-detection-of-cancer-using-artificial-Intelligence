# Early-detection-of-cancer-using-artificial-Intelligence
This project explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in the early detection of cancer. It discusses various machine learning and deep learning algorithms used to analyze medical data for identifying cancer at an early stage, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The paper reviews existing diagnostic methods, highlights AI models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-based detection, and evaluates their performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. It also emphasizes the benefits, challenges, and future scope of integrating AI in clinical practice for cancer diagnosis.
